# PS5Bot
## TLDR: This code can be used by people who are not programmers. It will be easier if you know how to code, but you can do without it.
## Project Overview
### Credit
This program is a modification of https://github.com/VVNoodle/PS5bot this guy's code. He made a wonderful project which taught me a lot about typescript and nodes and things I didn't even understand until I began this project. l even copied parts of his `README.md`, so dont give the credit to me for this project. All respect and most credit to this person who archived the project now sadly. That being said I did spend hours working on it and hope you make good use of it.

### Purpose
For right now the purpose of this bot is to help my friend buy a PSS. I am not a scammer or scalper. I am trying to help my friend who is having trouble buying a PSS becuase of all the scammers and scalpershing the release of the PSS
Keep in mind the MT License added, if something goes wrong and you accidentally order 10,000 PS5, nomy problem. However, I did workers to create a good user product and sincerely hope it benefits you. Also, I used this code on my own credit card and I trust it to do what I said it would do. I just put the license to get rid of any

### This isn't a high tech hacking bot

The PSSBot is not a high tech hacking bot, it is very simple. It is basically a refresh" bot. When you turn it on keep refreshing every 10 seconds until it sees the PS5 is back in stock. FOR THIS REASON, it will work beceron websites that don't tell you when they restock

For example, on the morning of Sunday November 22nd, Best Buy dropped PSS stock, no one knew they were going to do it at 5 am, so this bot might have caught it
I have been running this boton Best Buy and Target and have yet to actually buy a PS5 with it. However, I got it to buy paper for me from both Best Buy and Target, so we know it works
